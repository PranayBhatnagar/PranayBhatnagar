## 🌱 About Me

I work at **Cognida.ai**, crafting intelligent solutions that simplify real-world problems using **Python**, **FastAPI**, **GCS**, **DevOps practices**, and modern **GenAI tooling**.

I enjoy building systems that are smart, scalable, and a bit playful when they feel like it.  
I’m currently exploring **GenAI**, optimized workflows, and how to make AI behave more like an assistant and less like a comedian.

## ⚡ Fun Facts

- AI models know thousands of facts but still forget their own outputs sometimes. Same.
- I don’t drink coffee for energy. I drink it so my code compiles respectfully.
- AI won’t take my job. It’ll just automate the parts I secretly dislike.
