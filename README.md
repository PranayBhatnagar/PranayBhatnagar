<h3 align="center">AI-Driven Software Developer from Hyderabad, India</h3>

<div align="center">

 🔭 I am currently working at **Cognida.ai**, building **AI solutions** that try their best to behave like smart humans. Some days they do, some days they just hallucinate confidently.

 🤖 I work with **Python, FastAPI, GCS, CI/CD, DevOps, REST**, and everything that helps turn ideas into working AI systems.

 🌱 I am exploring **GenAI engineering**, workflow automation, and how to stop AI agents from thinking they are philosophers.

 💬 Let’s connect on **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pranay-bhatnagar/)**

 🎯 Quirky Thought:  
 If AI models ever gain self-awareness, will they finally understand why developers stare at the screen for 10 minutes before typing one line of code?

 ⚡ Fun Fact:  
 AI is great at solving problems, but sometimes it creates new ones too. Luckily solving those is also part of the fun.

 ❓ Random Question of the Day:  
 If an AI refuses to respond, is it debugging itself or silently judging your prompt?
